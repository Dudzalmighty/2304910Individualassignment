    <!-- Summary and Reflection on "Twelve Pillars" -->
</section>
<section id="Devinfo" >
  <h3><b>Pillar Four-</b></h3><h4 >  The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.:</h4><hr>
  <p>Setting a goal requires you to first envision your desired outcome before creating a plan of action to get there. Establishing goals gives you a target to work towards and helps you stay focused, which increases the likelihood that you will persevere through difficult situations to achieve your objectives. I have set a lot of goals for myself over the years, and I have to admit that some are quite successful. Right now, my main objective is to become a software engineer, and in order to do so, I need to get a degree in computer science. Knowing that goal will help me stay focused and endure sleepless nights in order to achieve it.

  <h3><b>Pillar Five-</b></h3><h4 >  Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.:</h4><hr>
  <p>The pain of discipline must be chosen over the agony of regret. You have to decide whether you want to do what's best for you right now or what's best for your future. For example, the night before an exam can be spent studying or partying. If you party, you might regret not studying, or you could have chosen to study and endure the pain of staying disciplined and not attending the party. According to pillar five, you have to select the course of action that will get you where you want to go. I constantly make an effort to put longevity ahead of immediate gratification.

<h3><b>Pillar six</b></h3><h4 >  Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.:</h4><hr>
<p>Your personality and level of achievement are directly correlated with the people you spend time with. Being able to unwind all the time is not something you should be in since it will prevent you from developing. Finding a second room is necessary if you turn out to be the smartest person in the room since without pressure, you won't grow in your career or your friendships. Regarding a career, you should constantly strive to learn new things and polish your abilities. As for companions, if your friends are too laid back and are unwilling to advance in life, you ought to find others who do, as they will inspire you to follow in their footsteps. That's the reason I constantly look for individuals that have objectives and work towards achieving them.

    <h3><b>Pillar seven-</b></h3><h4 >   Formal education will make you a living. Self education will make you a fortune:</h4><hr>
    <p>According to Pillar 7, understanding what one was taught in a formal education is insufficient. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement because formal schooling is only the beginning and plenty of people, even those much younger than you, will possess the same knowledge as you. For this reason, you must always be learning new things because it's necessary for you to grow as a person and expand your skill set. You won't be able to survive if all you know is what everyone else knows, but your value will increase if you are able to advance and gain additional knowledge on your own. This will allow you to excel in particular fields.
